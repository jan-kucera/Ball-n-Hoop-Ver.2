## Design
### Light
The whole conception of a model light differs completely from the previous version (*version 1*) of the model. Previously, we dismantled a LED bulb and used its components to make the model light. Now, we decided to make the light on our own. Thus, we have made a schematic and a PCB 3D model in Autodesk Eagle PCB designer.
